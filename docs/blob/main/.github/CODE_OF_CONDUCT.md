### Code of Conduct

- [x] I have read and agree to the GitHub Docs project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

### What article on docs.github.com is affected?

https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/available-rules-for-rulesets#require-status-checks-to-pass-before-merging

### What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?

The _Require Status Checks Before Merging_ section should more clearly mention that Github Actions (through their jobs) can be configured as status checks. The Github documentation page for status checks does mention this, however on the _Managing Rulesets_ page it does not. More importantly, there should be instructions on how to add a workflow job as a status check on this page--I was unable to find how to do this in any official documentation available. A workflow's job-level name key can be used to add a status check in a ruleset. This should either be explained in full on the _Managing Rulesets_ page, and if not there, then it should either be its own page or perhaps as part of the status check documentation. Providing users a brief example/step-by-step guide is not only helpful, but makes this process more transparent AND highly reputable since it would be in official documentation itself.
